The upcoming event in San Francisco will explore the impact of generative AI on business. While there is excitement about the potential of ChatGPT, there are also concerns about its limitations, ethical issues, and security vulnerabilities. From an IT perspective, there are questions about the trustworthiness of generative AI for critical tasks due to inaccuracies and reliability issues. Security vulnerabilities, particularly in relation to deepfake content, are also a concern. However, previous technologies faced skepticism initially but were widely adopted over time. Generative AI presents challenges related to fairness and bias, and psychologists can play a role in shaping responsible use by understanding user perspectives. Concerns about accuracy and job loss should be avoided, as generative AI can increase productivity and strategic importance. It has the potential to disrupt customer operations, sales and marketing, software development, and research and development. However, recent controversy surrounding AI-generated content for videogames raises copyright concerns, highlighting the need for developers to ensure they have the appropriate rights. Overall, generative AI offers productivity benefits and opportunities for businesses in various sectors.
