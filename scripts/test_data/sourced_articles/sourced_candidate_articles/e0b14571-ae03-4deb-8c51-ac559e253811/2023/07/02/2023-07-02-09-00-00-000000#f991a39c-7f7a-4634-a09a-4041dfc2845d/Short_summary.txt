The company is also lagging behind competitors in the high-bandwidth memory segment. However, Micron remains optimistic about its future with new AI-related products and initiatives. Other AI-related companies like AMD and Amazon have experienced significant stock growth, while Apple and Opera present themselves as attractive AI stocks with their respective strengths in consumer-tech and web browser AI tools.
