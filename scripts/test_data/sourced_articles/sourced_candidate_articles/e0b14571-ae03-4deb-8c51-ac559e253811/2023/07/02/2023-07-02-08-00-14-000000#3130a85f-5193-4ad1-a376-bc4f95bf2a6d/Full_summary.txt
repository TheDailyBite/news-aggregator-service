In addition to these highlights, it is important to note that family offices are increasingly becoming targets of cybersecurity attacks. According to Boston Private, over a quarter of family offices have experienced a cyberattack, with the majority of these attacks occurring within the last 12 months. Family offices face similar cybersecurity risks as other organizations, including phishing and ransomware attacks, data breaches, insider threats, and third-party risks. The emergence of generative AI has introduced new threat vectors, with hackers utilizing deep fakes and sophisticated phishing/vishing attacks.

To protect themselves, family offices should prioritize cybersecurity measures and seek external expertise. Large single family offices have the resources to create dedicated security departments and infrastructure for effective data protection. Employing best practices, conducting vulnerability tests, implementing protective measures, and continuously monitoring the organization's security framework are vital for robust cybersecurity. Family offices should also consider external audits and processes to ensure long-term safeguarding.

By investing in cybersecurity measures and conducting vulnerability tests, family offices can mitigate risks and avoid costly breaches. It is crucial for family offices to prioritize digital security and seek external expertise to ensure the protection of their sensitive information and assets.
