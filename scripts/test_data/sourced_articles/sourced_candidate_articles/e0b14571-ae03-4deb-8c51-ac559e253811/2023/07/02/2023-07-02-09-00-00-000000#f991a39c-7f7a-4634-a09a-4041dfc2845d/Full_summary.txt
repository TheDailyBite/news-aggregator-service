Micron Technology, a leading manufacturer of DRAM and NAND flash memory chips, has faced challenges in the AI market, resulting in underperformance compared to other AI-related companies. The company's stock experienced a decline after its third-quarter report on June 28, despite a 26% increase in stock value this year.

The reason behind Micron's underperformance can be attributed to the fact that the demand for AI chips is not yet sufficient to offset the decline in the mature PC and smartphone markets, which still account for a significant portion of memory demand. Additionally, Micron has fallen behind one of its major competitors, SK Hynix, in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, which is expected to grow rapidly due to the rise of generative AI.

Micron's delay in HBM memory production may come as a surprise to some shareholders, considering the company's success in traditional memory technology in recent years. Micron was the first to mass-produce 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND flash last year, which was seen as a positive indicator for the stock. However, in the case of HBM, Micron has fallen behind its competitors, particularly SK Hynix.

HBM, a specialized type of stacked DRAM, has gained traction due to its ability to handle large amounts of data quickly. While HBM was previously a niche market, the demand has surged with the growth of generative AI servers. Research suggests that HBM demand will increase by 60% this year and is expected to grow by another 30% in 2024. Micron currently holds a small share of this high-growth market, with around 10% market share, compared to SK Hynix's estimated 50% share and Samsung's 40% share.

Despite being behind in HBM, Micron remains optimistic about its future in the AI market. The company has highlighted several other AI-related products and its upcoming HBM3 "plus" product, which is set to be launched next year. Micron's CEO emphasized the company's leading products in other AI-related categories, such as high-density DDR5 memory and low-power memory, during the recent Q3 conference call. Micron's new HBM3 product is expected to offer higher bandwidth and performance compared to competing solutions.

Micron believes that its new products and initiatives will help it catch up and surpass its competitors in the AI market. The company anticipates a steep ramp-up in sales for its HBM3 product in early 2024 and aims to achieve higher market share in HBM than its overall DRAM market share of around 23%.

While Micron is currently facing losses in a challenging memory industry downturn, the company's improvements and the promising outlook for AI products provide reasons for optimism. With the demand for generative AI increasing and the market stabilizing, Micron has the potential to turn its performance around, although this may not occur until 2024.

In comparison to Micron, other companies in the AI industry have experienced significant stock growth. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Amazon are two attractive options, with AMD excelling in the hardware side of AI and Amazon making strides in software. AMD's diverse range of chips, including GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs, has caught the attention of major tech players, powering cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. On the other hand, Amazon's AWS leads the cloud market, and the company has been expanding its generative AI services.

Investing in the hardware side of the AI industry, like AMD, currently appears to be the more reliable option due to less competition compared to cloud services. While Micron faces challenges in the HBM segment, its focus on new AI-related products and initiatives provides hope for a recovery in the future.

Furthermore, the AI boom has attracted significant attention from investors and companies alike. OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT and Nvidia's better-than-expected guidance for the second quarter have fueled excitement in the AI space. However, many well-known AI stocks have already seen their valuations spike, even without showing substantial positive results from the AI boom. Nvidia, for instance, now trades at a high price-to-earnings ratio, and C3.ai's price-to-sales ratio is elevated despite flat revenue growth.

In this context, Apple emerges as a potentially attractive AI stock. While the company has not heavily emphasized its AI ambitions, it stands to benefit from the AI boom due to its suite of devices that can serve as platforms for the technology. Apple's Vision Pro, a mixed reality headset, utilizes machine learning to enable various functionalities, such as rendering a full image of the user's face for FaceTime. The Vision Pro's introduction positions Apple at the forefront of the next computing platform, making it a strong contender in the AI space.

Apple's consumer-tech ecosystem, bolstered by its brand equity, vast installed base of complementary devices, and the Vision Pro, has the potential to thrive in the AI era. As investors consider building an AI stock portfolio, Apple presents itself as a compelling choice.

In the broader AI industry, Nvidia has been a standout performer, with its stock surging 187% in 2023 and its valuation reaching $1 trillion. However, there is another small-cap AI stock that has outperformed even Nvidia. Opera, a web browser company based in Oslo, Norway, has seen its shares soar 203% this year and currently trade at an all-time high.

Opera has developed a web browser with built-in AI tools, including a generative AI chatbot called Aria and a partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company's browser also caters to gamers with a specialized version called Opera GX, which has gained popularity among users.

Despite its strong gains, Opera remains attractively valued with a market capitalization of $1.6 billion. The company has been steadily growing its revenue and has been profitable since 2017. Opera's focus on efficiency and monetization has led to an increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) and enabled the company to return money to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Compared to other AI stocks, Opera's valuation appears reasonable, with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 4.6. In contrast, AI software company C3.ai trades at a P/S of 13.1, and Nvidia trades at a multiple of 39.3. While Opera may not reach the same level as Nvidia in the AI industry, its growth potential in the internet search and gaming markets positions it for further upside.

In conclusion, Micron Technology faces challenges in the AI market due to the demand for AI chips not yet offsetting the decline in traditional memory markets and its lag behind competitors in the HBM segment. However, the company remains optimistic about its future with new AI-related products and initiatives. Other AI-related companies, such as AMD and Amazon, have experienced significant stock growth, with AMD excelling in hardware and Amazon making strides in software. Apple also presents itself as an attractive AI stock with its consumer-tech ecosystem and the introduction of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset. Additionally, Opera, a small-cap AI stock, has outperformed larger players like Nvidia and offers an attractive valuation with its web browser and built-in AI tools.

On the other hand, Wolfspeed's growth cooled off during the pandemic, but it has gradually recovered in markets like automotive and radio frequency (RF) chips. The company expects further growth in fiscal 2023, driven by the opening of its new silicon carbide plant. Wolfspeed's first-mover advantage in the silicon carbide space is seen as a potential long-term investment, although it faces competition from other chipmakers.

While both companies have their strengths and challenges, Nvidia's stock is currently considered more favorable due to its recent growth and strong position in the AI market. Wolfspeed, on the other hand, faces tougher competitive headwinds and has yet to achieve profitability.

In summary, Nvidia's stock is expected to continue outperforming Wolfspeed in the near future, but investors should carefully consider the risks and opportunities associated with each company.
