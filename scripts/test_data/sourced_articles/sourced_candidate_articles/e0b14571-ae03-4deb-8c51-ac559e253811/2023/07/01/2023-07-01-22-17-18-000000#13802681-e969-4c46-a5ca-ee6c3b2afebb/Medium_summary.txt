Generative AI is a practical and user-friendly form of AI that has the potential to enhance productivity and streamline processes in various industries. Contrary to popular belief, AI is not a threat to job security, but rather individuals with AI skills are more likely to secure employment opportunities. Generative AI can be categorized into two main types: transformers and diffusers. Transformers are used for language generation, while diffusers are used for image generation. To get started with generative AI, it is important to identify tasks that can benefit from automation, such as content creation. Several software packages already integrate generative AI features that can assist with these tasks. When starting with generative AI, it is recommended to begin with foundational tools that offer low barriers to entry and basic capabilities. OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing's Image Creator are suitable tools for working with transformers and diffusers, respectively. By understanding the basics of generative AI and gradually exploring more advanced options, individuals can leverage this technology effectively to revolutionize various industries.
