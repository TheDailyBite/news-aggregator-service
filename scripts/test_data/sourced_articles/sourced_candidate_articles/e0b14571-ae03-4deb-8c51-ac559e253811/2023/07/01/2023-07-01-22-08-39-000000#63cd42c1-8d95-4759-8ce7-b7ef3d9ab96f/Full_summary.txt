Brigitte VÃ©zina, Director of Policy and Open Culture at CC, recently participated in a panel discussion hosted by the European Internet Forum on the topic of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on copyright and art. The panel, which took place in the context of EU negotiations on the Artificial Intelligence Act, included representatives from various stakeholders, including rightholders, AI developers, and CC as the sole representative of civil society advocating for the public interest.

During the discussion, several copyright-related issues related to AI training, transparency, safeguards, and AI-generated outputs were addressed. CC highlighted their longstanding examination of the relationship between copyright and AI, with a focus on how these technologies can contribute to the commons, foster creativity, and promote inclusive and sustainable sharing.

It was emphasized that the regulation of generative AI should involve a diverse and global community with expertise in copyright, ethics, privacy, data protection, and fundamental human rights. This collaborative approach is crucial to ensure that the promises of AI are realized and its potential risks are mitigated.

CC reaffirmed their commitment to representing the public interest in AI policy negotiations and to engaging and expanding their global community to enhance understanding of AI's impact on the commons. They invited interested individuals to join their Global Summit in Mexico City in October 2023, where the theme will be AI & the Commons.

CC acknowledged the complexity of the issues raised by generative AI and expressed their focus on the intersection of copyright law and this technology. They are actively exploring how their strategy for better sharing can support the development of generative AI while respecting the rights of human creators. Additionally, they are committed to ensuring that AI operates within a better internet environment for everyone. CC is addressing these concerns through a series of blog posts by their team and invited guests, covering topics such as AI inputs, AI outputs, and the various ways people utilize AI. Interested readers can find an overview of generative AI and access all related posts on CC's website.

In related news, concerns have been raised by The Authors Guild, the oldest and largest professional organization for published writers in the US, regarding the use of copyrighted materials in training AI models. The Guild argues that much of the text used to train AI systems is from original works and is being used without consent, potentially infringing on copyright laws. In an open letter addressed to prominent AI technology leaders, including CEOs of OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, Stability AI, and IBM, the Guild requests that these companies obtain consent, give credit, and provide fair compensation to the writers and creators of the copyrighted materials used in their AI training.

The letter also calls for the companies to take steps to alleviate the impact by obtaining permission for the use of copyrighted material, compensating writers fairly for past and ongoing use, and compensating writers for the use of their works in AI output, regardless of whether it infringes current law.

Furthermore, OpenAI is facing a lawsuit alleging the use of pirated content in the training of their ChatGPT model. The lawsuit claims that the authors never gave permission for their works to be used, yet ChatGPT can accurately summarize their writings, suggesting that the information must have been sourced from somewhere unauthorized.

Writers who wish to support the Authors Guild's open letter can add their names to the list of signatories. The letter aims to address the concerns surrounding the use of copyrighted materials in AI training and ensure fair treatment of writers and creators in the development and output of AI systems.
