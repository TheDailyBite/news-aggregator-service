A panel discussion on generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on copyright and art was recently held, with representatives from various stakeholders participating. The discussion focused on copyright-related issues related to AI training, transparency, safeguards, and AI-generated outputs. The panel emphasized the importance of involving a diverse and global community with expertise in copyright, ethics, privacy, data protection, and fundamental human rights in the regulation of generative AI. The Creative Commons (CC) organization reaffirmed its commitment to representing the public interest in AI policy negotiations and invited interested individuals to join their Global Summit in Mexico City in October 2023. CC acknowledged the complexity of the issues raised by generative AI and expressed their focus on the intersection of copyright law and this technology. They are actively exploring how their strategy for better sharing can support the development of generative AI while respecting the rights of human creators. In related news, The Authors Guild has raised concerns about the use of copyrighted materials in training AI models. They argue that much of the text used is from original works and is being used without consent, potentially infringing on copyright laws. The Guild has sent an open letter to prominent AI technology leaders, requesting consent, credit, and fair compensation for writers and creators. OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit alleging the use of pirated content in the training of their ChatGPT model. The lawsuit claims that authors never gave permission for their works to be used. The Authors Guild's open letter aims to address concerns surrounding the use of copyrighted materials in AI training and ensure fair treatment of writers and creators in the development and output of AI systems.
